## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have ideas for new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. For feature requests, it's a good idea to discuss them beforehand to ensure they're aligned with the app's goals.

### Disclaimer

Please note that the codebase is still in an early stage. It was initially created as a learning project to explore Rust and solve my own needs. As such, the code is "dirty" and lacks proper tests (which will be added in the near future).

The project is open to large refactors and improvements. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to dive into the code, suggest improvements, or help clean it up.

### Prerequisites

- Install Node.js. I recommend you to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
